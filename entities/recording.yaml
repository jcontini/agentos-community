# Extends media. Inherits:
#   From media: id, title, description, url, published_at, duration_ms, thumbnail
#
# For personal recordings: voice memos, phone calls, meeting recordings.
# Distinguished from `audio` by intent — recordings are captured moments,
# not published content.
#
# Attribution: The person who made the recording. For calls/meetings,
# use `call_participants` to list all people involved.
