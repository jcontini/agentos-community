# Result — A Search Engine's Record of a Web Resource
#
# A result is NOT a webpage. It's a record — a snapshot of what
# a search engine knew about a URL at index time. The page may
# have changed or may no longer exist. The result is the index
# pointer, not the thing itself.
#
# Like a library catalog card: it describes where to find a book
# and what it's about, but it's not the book.
#
# Extends record. Inherits: id, name, value.
#
# The URL connects results to webpages implicitly. When a result
# at https://example.com exists and someone later does webpage.read
# on that URL, the webpage entity shares the same URL. No explicit
# relationship needed — the URL is the natural join key.
#
# Results live inside searches (via `includes` relationship with
# position metadata for rank).
