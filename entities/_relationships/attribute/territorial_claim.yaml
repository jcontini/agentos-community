# Territorial Claim — Actor Claims Territory
#
# The foundational relationship for epistemic honesty about places.
# We never assert that a country "owns" or "is" a territory.
# We assert that an actor CLAIMS it, with what type of authority,
# sourced to what document, valid for what period.
#
# This is how we model Kashmir (India, Pakistan, and China all have
# territorial claims with different claim_types and sources),
# Taiwan (self-determined de jure + de facto; PRC claims de jure only),
# Crimea (Russia de facto since 2014; Ukraine de jure continuously),
# and Bir Tawil (claimed_by nobody — neither Egypt nor Sudan wants it).
#
# Claim types:
#   de_jure      — legal/constitutional assertion of sovereignty
#   de_facto     — actual administrative control on the ground
#   self_determined — what the local government/population claims for itself
#   recognized   — formal international diplomatic recognition
#
# The source field should point to a specific document: a treaty, a
# constitution, a UN resolution, a declaration of independence.
# A claim without a source is opinion. A sourced claim is data.
#
# Temporal bounds come from the relationship's built-in started_at/ended_at.
