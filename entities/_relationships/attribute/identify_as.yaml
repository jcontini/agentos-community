# Identify As — Self-Identity Claims
#
# The actor claims an identity. "You identify as Joe Contini."
# "You identify as a builder." "You identify as American."
#
# This is the deepest assertion — who you ARE, not what you DO.
# The "You" entity is the persistent observer. Identities are
# contextual and temporal. They start, they can end.
#
# Different from `claim` (which links to accounts/credentials).
# identify_as links to people, roles, groups — representations
# of self that may change across contexts or lifetimes.
