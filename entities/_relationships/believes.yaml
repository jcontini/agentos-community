# Believes — What You Hold to Be True
#
# A person or organization's conviction about an outcome's truth.
# Strength on a spectrum from -1 (certain it's false) to +1 (certain it's true).
# Changes over time — event-sourced, current = most recent.
#
# Belief is independent of desire. You can want something you think
# is false, or dread something you think is true.
#
# Works across all kinds of beliefs:
#   Past claims: "COVID originated in a lab" — what do you think happened?
#   Metaphysical: "God exists" — faith, conviction, worldview
#   Empirical: "Vaccines are beneficial" — what does the evidence say?
#   Normative: "Bodily autonomy is a right" — what ought to be true?
#   Predictions: "Fed cuts rates by June" — what will happen?
#
# Polymarket/Kalshi = marketplace of belief strength on time-bound outcomes.
# The temporal dimension is on the outcome, not the belief.

      How strongly they hold this outcome to be true (+) or false (-).

      +1.0  = "Certain this is true." (fact, faith, or deep conviction)
      +0.7  = "I'm pretty confident this is true."
      +0.3  = "I think this is probably true."
       0.0  = "I genuinely don't know."
      -0.3  = "I think this is probably not true."
      -0.7  = "I'm pretty confident this is false."
      -1.0  = "Certain this is NOT true."
