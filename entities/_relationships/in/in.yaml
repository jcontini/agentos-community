# In — Something belonging to a place
#
# The universal non-exclusive membership pattern. A song is in a playlist,
# a video is in a channel, an actor is in a group — membership that doesn't
# imply the thing is nowhere else.
#
# From PROV-O: hadMember. Dublin Core: hasPart.
#
# Abstract — never used directly. Children: upload, publish, add_to,
# set, file_in, tag, post, join, includes.
