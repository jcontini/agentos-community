# Add — Abstract Placement Relationship
#
# Never used directly. All placement relationships extend add:
# upload, publish, add_to, set, file_in, tag.
#
# Replaces the old `contains` relationship. The key shift:
# "contains" is passive state ("this place contains X").
# "add" is an action ("someone added X to this place").
# Current state is computed by netting add/remove edges.
