# Contains — Universal Membership Relationship
#
# Connects a collection to its members. This is a many-to-many
# relationship: an entity can be in many collections, a collection
# can contain many entities.
#
# Direction: collection → entity ("this collection contains X")
#
# Evolved from `tagged` (entity → tag). Renamed and flipped direction
# because `contains` is the natural verb for all collection types:
# a tag contains items, an album contains photos, a playlist contains songs.
#
# Phase 1: collection ↔ outcome (Todoist labels, Linear labels)
# Phase 2: extend from_type/to_type as more collection types appear
#   (albums, playlists, folders, etc.)
