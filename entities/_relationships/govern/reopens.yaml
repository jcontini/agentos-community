# Reopens — Directive Speech Act: "This commitment needs more work"
#
# An actor declares a previously completed commitment is not actually
# done. This reverses the effect of a prior `completes` relationship.
#
# The task's computed `done` field checks whether the most recent
# lifecycle act is `completes` or `reopens`. If the last act is
# `reopens`, done is false.
#
# This follows Searle's speech act taxonomy: a directive act where
# the speaker asks the world to change (more work is needed).
