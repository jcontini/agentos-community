# Establish — Actor Brings a Fiat Place Into Existence
#
# The founding act. An authority exercises power and a new fiat entity
# comes into being: a country declares independence, a parliament
# creates a new province, a city charter is signed.
#
# This is the relationship that replaces `valid_from` as a property
# on fiat places. The founding date is not a stored field — it's the
# `started_at` of this relationship. The founding authority is the
# `from` actor. The founding document (Declaration of Independence,
# a treaty, a constitution) is captured in `source`.
#
# Anti: abolish — the same authority (or a successor/conqueror) can
# dissolve what was established.
