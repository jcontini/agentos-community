# Manages — Actor directs a narrative
#
# An actor manages a project, roadmap, or other narrative.
# Stronger than "includes" (curation), weaker than "owns"
# (property). The manager sets direction, makes decisions,
# is accountable for the outcome.
#
# "You manage agentOS." "You manage the Q1 roadmap."
