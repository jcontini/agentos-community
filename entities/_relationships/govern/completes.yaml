# Completes — Assertive Speech Act: "This commitment is fulfilled"
#
# An actor declares a commitment done. This is the source of truth
# for completion — the task entity's `done` field is computed from
# the presence (or absence) of this relationship.
#
# If a task is later reopened (via `reopens` relationship), done
# flips back to false. The most recent speech act wins.
#
# This follows Searle's speech act taxonomy: an assertive act where
# the speaker claims the world matches their words (the commitment
# has been fulfilled).
