# Succeed — A Fiat Place Succeeds Another
#
# Identity succession between fiat entities. When one jurisdiction
# directly follows from another — through dissolution, partition,
# merger, or independence — we record the succession as a graph
# edge, not as stored arrays on each entity.
#
# This replaces the `replaces`/`replaced_by` property arrays that
# would otherwise clutter fiat entity schemas. Everything is on
# the graph, derivable by traversal.
#
# The direction is: the NEW entity succeeds the OLD entity.
#   new_country --succeed--> old_country
#
# Examples:
#   Russia --succeed--> Soviet Union
#   Czech Republic --succeed--> Czechoslovakia
#   Slovakia --succeed--> Czechoslovakia
#   Germany (reunified) --succeed--> East Germany
#   Germany (reunified) --succeed--> West Germany
#   Myanmar --succeed--> Burma  (rename — same territory, new fiat identity)
#
# Note: "same place, different name" (Burma → Myanmar) and "new place
# from old" (Yugoslavia → Serbia + others) are both succeed edges.
# The distinction is in how many successors there are (1 = rename,
# many = partition) and whether the geography is the same.
