# Abolish — Authority Dissolves a Fiat Place
#
# The anti of establish. A fiat entity ceases to exist: a country
# is dissolved (Soviet Union, 1991), a territory is absorbed into
# another jurisdiction, a city is annexed.
#
# The `ended_at` of this relationship is when the entity ceased to
# exist — the `valid_until` date as a graph fact rather than a
# stored property.
#
# Examples:
#   Gorbachev (Soviet government) --abolish--> Soviet Union
#     started_at: 1991-12-25, source: "Alma-Ata Declaration"
#
#   Yugoslav Assembly --abolish--> Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
#     started_at: 1992-04-28
