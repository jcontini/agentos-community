# Reports To — Organizational authority chain
#
# An actor reports to another actor. Standard team/org terminology.
# "opencode reports to Joe Contini" — the agent works under the
# person's authority. Works for humans too: "intern reports to lead."
#
# This is how agents relate to their operators. The agent is the
# subject (from), the person they report to is the target (to).
