# Mention — Abstract Reference Relationship
#
# Never used directly. All reference relationships extend mention:
# embed, link_to, cite, transcribe, express_as, adapt, translate, cover.
#
# Replaces the old `references` relationship. The key shift:
# "references" was a catch-all with roles. Now each type of
# reference is a first-class relationship with its own semantics.
