# Replies To — Threaded Discussion Edge
#
# A post or message that is a direct reply to another post or message.
# This is the universal threading relationship — every comment system
# on every platform uses this pattern.
#
# Direction: reply → parent (the reply knows what it's replying to).
# This matches every standard:
#   - Schema.org: parentItem (reply → parent)
#   - ActivityStreams: inReplyTo (reply → parent)
#   - SIOC: reply_of (reply → parent, formal owl:inverseOf has_reply)
#
# The inverse ("Has replies") is computed by traversal — query all
# entities where replies_to points to the parent.
#
# Threading depth is unlimited. A reply to a reply is just another
# replies_to edge. The root of any thread is found by traversing
# replies_to until you reach an entity with no replies_to edge.
#
# Comments ARE posts. A YouTube comment, Reddit comment, HN comment,
# GitHub issue comment, blog comment — they're all post entities
# with a replies_to relationship to their parent.
