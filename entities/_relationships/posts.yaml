# Posts — Content Attribution to Platform Account
#
# The relationship between a platform account and the content it
# posted. This is what we can OBSERVE — an account posted something.
# Whether the human behind the account authored it, curated it,
# or shared it is a separate question.
#
# Direction: account → content ("this account posts this content")
#
# The full attribution chain:
#   Person --claims--> Account --posts--> Post/Video
#
# Why account, not person:
#   - A YouTube channel IS an account. We can observe it posted a video.
#   - A Reddit username IS an account. We can observe it posted a comment.
#   - The person behind the account is a separate inference (claims relationship).
#   - Brand accounts can be operated by multiple people.
#   - The same person can post via different accounts.
#
# Why "posted" not "authored" or "created":
#   - "Authored" implies original creation — but a Reddit user might
#     post a link to someone else's article.
#   - "Created" is ambiguous (created the content? created the post?)
#   - "Posted" is exactly what happened — the account posted it to
#     the platform. No more, no less.
#
# Already in use (informally as `posted_by`) by Reddit and HN adapters.
# YouTube migrating from `created_by` to `posts` in Phase 3.
