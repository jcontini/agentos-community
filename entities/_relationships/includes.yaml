# Includes — Curation
#
# A journey explicitly includes an outcome. Used for outcomes that
# aren't inferred from the goal + enables graph.
#
# Most journeys don't need many includes — the enables graph does
# the heavy lifting via the goal outcome. Includes is for:
#   - Bucket lists (no goal, all explicit)
#   - Optional detours (nice-to-haves)
#   - Non-causal additions (things that don't causally enable the goal)
#   - Overrides (explicitly including something the graph wouldn't infer)
#
# Skills rename includes:
#   Roadmap=Includes, Trip="Stops at", OKR=Measures,
#   Bucket List="Dreams of", Story=Features, Sprint=Delivers
