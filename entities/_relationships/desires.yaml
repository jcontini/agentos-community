# Desires — What You Want
#
# A person or organization's desire (or aversion) regarding an outcome.
# Strength on a spectrum from -1 (absolute aversion) to +1 (non-negotiable).
# Changes over time — event-sourced, current = most recent.
#
# Desire is independent of belief is independent of action.
# Wanting something, believing it will happen, and working toward it
# are three separate facts.
