# References — The Universal Graph Edge
#
# Any entity can reference any other entity, with a role
# describing the nature of the connection. This is the
# general-purpose relationship type for building a knowledge graph.
#
# Unlike typed relationships (enables, contains), references is
# open-ended. The `role` property carries the semantics:
#
#   about       — primary subject ("this doc is about X")
#   mentions    — referenced in passing ("this doc mentions Y")
#   cites       — formal attribution ("this paper cites Z")
#   inspired_by — creative influence ("this project was inspired by W")
#   derived_from — adaptation, fork, remix
#   responds_to — reply, reaction, rebuttal
#   related_to  — general association (weakest link)
#
# Roles are open strings, not an enum. New roles emerge as the
# graph grows. Adapters, agents, and users can introduce roles
# without schema changes.
#
# Research lineage:
#   - Dublin Core "relation" element (15 core elements for documents)
#   - Schema.org mentions/about (CreativeWork properties)
#   - NEPOMUK NIE ontology (content relationships)
#   - Open Graph Protocol (structured web references)
#
# Examples:
#   vision (document) ──references (about)──→ symbiosis (concept)
#   vision (document) ──references (cites)──→ Licklider (person)
#   video  ──references (mentions)──→ SQLite (project)
#   person ──references (inspired_by)──→ another person
