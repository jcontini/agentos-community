# Tagged — Universal Tagging Relationship
#
# Connects any entity to a tag. This is a many-to-many relationship:
# an entity can have many tags, a tag can apply to many entities.
#
# Direction: entity → tag ("this outcome is tagged with X")
#
# Phase 1: outcome ↔ tag (Todoist labels, Linear labels)
# Phase 2: extend from_type as more adapters use tags
#   (photos, bookmarks, conversations, etc.)
