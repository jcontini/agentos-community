# Decision — An Outcome That Resolves a Question
#
# A decision captures what was chosen, what was rejected, and why.
# Extends outcome — inherits name, description, value, target,
# achieved (= when the decision was made), ended, output, etc.
#
# Options are structured data, not separate entities.
# The decision itself is the outcome; options are its analysis.
