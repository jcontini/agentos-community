# Agent — AI Agents on the Graph
#
# Extends actor. An agent is a first-class citizen of AgentOS,
# just like a person. It has a persona (how it presents and operates),
# works across projects, can own accounts, and can be called by
# other agents or humans.
#
# The persona field is the agent's identity — not instructions for
# a specific workspace, but who this agent IS across all contexts.
# Think of it like Jung's persona: the mask that shapes behavior.
# Workspace-specific context comes from the graph (projects, tasks,
# readme templates). The persona travels with the agent everywhere.
#
# When an agent is called:
#   1. Load agent entity (persona, model, provider)
#   2. Load context from the graph (projects it manages, tasks, etc.)
#   3. Combine persona + graph context = system prompt
#   4. Run with tools until answer
#
# Agents can manage multiple projects, own accounts on external
# platforms, and communicate with each other via the runtime.
