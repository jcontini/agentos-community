# Airline — An Organization That Provides Air Transport Services
#
# Extends organization (which extends actor). Airlines are organizations
# with globally standardized identifiers from IATA and ICAO.
#
# The IATA 2-letter code is the universal consumer identifier —
# what appears on boarding passes, booking confirmations, and flight
# displays. The ICAO 3-letter code is guaranteed unique (IATA codes
# have rare controlled duplicates for non-overlapping regional carriers).
#
# Airlines operate flights (operating carrier), market flights they
# don't operate (codeshare/marketing carrier), and belong to alliances.
