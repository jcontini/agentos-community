# Software — Digital Products and Services
#
# Extends work. Apps, platforms, APIs, protocols, operating systems,
# games, libraries, frameworks. Replaces the old `product` entity
# for digital things. Physical products use `hardware` instead.
#
# This is also what accounts live on — platforms:
#   Account: @sarahchen → on_platform → Software: Twitter/X
#   Account: +62-812-345-6789 → on_platform → Software: Phone (PSTN)
#
# Richness lives in relationships:
#   software → made_by → organization
#   software → offered_by → organization
#   adapter → extends → software (adapters are software)
#   repository → hosts → software (source code)
