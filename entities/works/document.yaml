# Document — Text-Centric Published Content
#
# Extends work. Inherits: id, title, description, url, expressed_at, created_date.
#
# Posts and webpages are documents. Messages extend post (which
# extends document) in the chain: work → document → post → message.
#
# Attribution via relationships:
#   account --posts--> post (for social media)
#   actor --cite--> document (formal attribution)
#
# The `data` bag is the extension point for adapter-specific
# properties.
