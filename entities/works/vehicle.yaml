# Vehicle — A Specific Motor Vehicle
#
# Extends hardware (which extends work). Unlike aircraft (which
# represents a model), a vehicle is a specific physical instance —
# Joe's 2017 Honda Accord Hybrid, VIN ..., plate SMY9958.
#
# For personal use, a vehicle is something you own, have owned,
# or are interested in buying. It has a VIN, a plate, an odometer,
# and a history.
#
# For the TxDMV skill, vehicles need VIN, plate, year, make, model
# to fill government forms (VTR-146 address change, VTR-60 transfer
# notification, etc.).
#
# Richness lives in relationships:
#   vehicle → owned_by → person
#   vehicle → registered_in → place (state/county)
#   vehicle → made_by → organization
#   document (title, registration, insurance) → about → vehicle
