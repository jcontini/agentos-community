# Skill — An Installed Skill in the AgentOS Ecosystem
#
# Every skill that the system detects on disk becomes an entity in the
# graph. This is how the system models itself — skills aren't just
# runtime configs, they're first-class entities with relationships to
# products, organizations, repositories, and people.
#
# On server startup, after seed entities are processed, the system
# creates an entity for each loaded skill. This is idempotent —
# existing skill entities are skipped.
#
# Richness lives in relationships:
#   skill → connects_to → product (the service it integrates with)
#   skill → hosted_at → repository (source code)
#   skill → authored_by → person/organization
#
# The skill → product → organization chain makes the full ecosystem
# graph traversable:
#   YouTube skill → connects_to → YouTube (product) → offered_by → Google (org)
#
