# Model — AI Language Models and Foundation Models
#
# Extends work. A specific versioned release of an AI model — e.g.,
# claude-3-5-haiku-20241022, gpt-4o-2024-11-20, llama-3.2-90b.
#
# Key design choices:
#   - No `status` field — epistemic truth only. `released` is a date fact.
#     If deprecated, `deprecated` records when that happened.
#   - Cost reflects best-known-at-time. It changes; snapshot is still useful.
#   - Benchmarks are separate entities (see benchmark.yaml) connected via
#     `scored_on` relationships — not embedded here.
#
# Richness lives in relationships:
#   model → published_by → organization
#   model → successor_to → model (prior version)
#   model → version_of → model (the family, e.g. "claude-3-5-haiku")
#   model → scored_on → benchmark (with score + date in relationship data)
#
# Skills seed these — the anthropic skill seeds all Claude models. This way
# the moment a new model is seeded (via skill update or auto-discovery),
# every intelligence-aware feature automatically sees it.
