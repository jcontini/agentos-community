# Aircraft — A Model of Aircraft
#
# Extends hardware (which extends work). An aircraft is a
# specific model — Boeing 737-800, Airbus A350-900, Embraer 175.
# A product designed and manufactured by an organization.
#
# This is the model, not a specific airframe. A specific physical
# aircraft (tail number N12345) would be an instance with a
# registration number. For most consumer/travel use cases, the
# model is what matters — you want to know you're on a 787, not
# which specific 787.
#
# Identified by IATA 3-character equipment codes (used in
# reservation systems and timetables) and ICAO 4-character type
# designators (used in flight planning and ATC).
#
# References:
#   IATA SSIM Appendix A (3-character type codes)
#   ICAO Doc 8643 (4-character type designators)
