# Album — A Collection of Images
#
# Extends place. Photo albums, wallpaper collections, mood boards —
# any container for images. Items get added via the `add_to`
# relationship. Photos already reference albums via their `album`
# property.
#
# The "Wallpapers" album is seeded by the system — any image added
# to it becomes available in the Settings wallpaper picker.
