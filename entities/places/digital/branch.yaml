# Branch — A Named Location in a Repository
#
# A branch is a place where work happens. Code lives on a branch.
# Commits land on a branch. You switch to a branch. It's a named
# pointer — the simplest container in git.
#
# Only stores what a branch IS, not its current state. A branch's
# ahead/behind count, HEAD commit, and dirty status are all
# ephemeral — they change with every push, fetch, and commit.
# Query those live via the git skill's status utility.
#
# Graph:
#   branch → in → repository
