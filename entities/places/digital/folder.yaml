# Folder — A Directory on Disk
#
# A local place where files live. May host a git repository,
# may not. The folder is the physical location; the repository
# is what lives there.
#
# Folders are the entry point for project detection: a session
# has a workspace path → look up the folder → follow includes
# back to the project.
