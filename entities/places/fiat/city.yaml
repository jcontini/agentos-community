# City — A Municipality or Urban Jurisdiction
#
# Fiat entity — specifically the administrative jurisdiction.
# A city is simultaneously three things:
#   1. An administrative unit (legal boundary, government, jurisdiction) ← this entity
#   2. A physical settlement (the built environment of streets and buildings)
#   3. A social concentration (people, culture, economic activity)
#
# These three often don't coincide. "The City of London" (administrative,
# ~8,600 people) vs "London" (metropolitan settlement, ~9 million) is the
# classic example. We model the administrative unit here; the settlement
# and built environment are separate concerns.
#
# Population is always a claim — sourced from a census or estimate by
# some authority at some point in time. Use population_source and
# population_as_of to capture this.
#
# Temporal: city boundaries and names change. Königsberg became Kaliningrad.
# Saigon became Ho Chi Minh City. These temporal facts live on the graph:
#   Actor --establish--> City, Actor --abolish--> City
#   NewCity --succeed--> OldCity (succession_type: rename)
