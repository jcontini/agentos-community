# Region — State, Province, Prefecture, Territory
#
# Fiat entity. Administrative subdivision of a country — exists because
# a legal framework says it does. Can be renamed, merged, split, or
# dissolved by the same authority that created it.
#
# The `region_type` field acknowledges that different jurisdictions use
# different terms: US has states, UK has counties and nations, France
# has départements, Japan has prefectures. They're all the same
# ontological thing: a fiat administrative subdivision.
#
# Temporal: regions change. East and West Germany reunified. The Soviet
# republics became independent. Temporal facts live on the graph:
#   Actor --establish--> Region (started_at = creation date)
#   Actor --abolish--> Region (started_at = dissolution date)
#   NewRegion --succeed--> OldRegion
