# Country — A Sovereign State or Territory
#
# Fiat entity. Countries exist because they're declared — by constitutions,
# treaties, international recognition, or conquest. The boundary between
# India and Pakistan in Kashmir isn't drawn by mountains; it's drawn by
# competing claims with guns behind them.
#
# Epistemic honesty: we model claims about countries, not countries as
# ground truth. The `territorial_claim` relationship expresses who claims
# what, with what type of authority, sourced to what document.
#
# Temporal: a country's lifespan is graph-computed, not stored:
#   - Founded: Actor --establish--> Country (started_at = founding date)
#   - Dissolved: Actor --abolish--> Country (started_at = dissolution date)
#   - Succession: NewCountry --succeed--> OldCountry
# These are govern relationships, not properties. "When did this country
# come into being?" is answered by traversal, not by reading valid_from.
