# Search — A Query Executed Against a Source
#
# A search is a place where results were found. Like a playlist
# contains songs or a folder contains files, a search contains
# results — ordered by position (rank).
#
# Extends place. Inherits: id, name, description.
#
# The query is the identity. The results are related via
# `includes` relationships with position metadata.
#
# Works for any search source:
#   - Web search (Exa, Brave, Google)
#   - File search (Google Drive, Dropbox)
#   - Entity search (Memex)
#   - Code search (GitHub)
#
# The search entity is a record of asking a question and getting
# answers. Individual results are `result` entities (records of
# what the search engine knew about each URL at index time).
#
# Ontological grounding:
#   - PROV-O: Activity that generated a Collection
#   - Schema.org: SearchAction (action) + SearchResultsPage (place)
#   - OpenSearch: Response feed with Query metadata
#   - People talk about searches as places: "I found it on Google",
#     "it's the #1 spot", "go back to the search"
