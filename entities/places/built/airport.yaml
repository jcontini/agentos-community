# Airport — A Place Where Aircraft Take Off and Land
#
# Extends place (built/). Airports are physically real human-made
# structures — they slot into places/built/ alongside venue. The
# existing venue.yaml even lists "airport" as a venue_type example,
# but airports warrant their own type because they have globally
# standardized aviation identifiers (IATA/ICAO codes) that are
# used as query parameters across every flight API.
#
# An airport's IATA code is its primary identifier in practice —
# "JFK", "LAX", "NRT" are universally understood shorthand. The
# ICAO code is more precise but less commonly used outside aviation
# systems ("KJFK", "KLAX", "RJAA").
