# Venue — A Building, Park, Stadium, or Named Physical Location
#
# Bona fide-adjacent: venues are physically real — you can stand in them,
# touch their walls. Unlike administrative places, a venue's existence
# doesn't depend on legal declarations. The building exists even if the
# city government that issued its permit dissolves.
#
# However, venues do have names and purposes that are socially assigned.
# A stadium is a stadium because of what happens there and what we call it.
# The physical structure is bona fide; the designation is fiat.
