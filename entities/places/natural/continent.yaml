# Continent — A Major Landmass
#
# Mostly bona fide — large-scale physical geography. The landmasses
# themselves are physically real. But: the divisions are partly fiat.
# Eurasia is one continuous landmass. "Europe" and "Asia" are cultural
# constructs — the Ural Mountains convention was a 18th-century decision
# by Swedish military officer Philip Johan von Strahlenberg, not a
# natural boundary.
#
# The continent count varies by culture:
#   7 (Anglo-American model): Africa, Antarctica, Asia, Australia/Oceania,
#     Europe, North America, South America
#   6 (merged Americas): Africa, Antarctica, Australia/Oceania,
#     Eurasia, America
#   6 (merged Eurasia): Africa, Antarctica, America, Australia/Oceania,
#     Europe, Asia
#
# For epistemic honesty: Eurasia is the bona fide physical entity.
# Europe and Asia are cultural/historical divisions — closer to
# administrative or narrative categories than physical ones.
