# Account Entity — Platform Identity
#
# A social media account, handle, or profile on a specific platform.
# NOT a person — an account is a platform identity that a person
# claims. One person can have many accounts. One account can be
# claimed by multiple people (brand accounts). An account can exist
# with no known person (anonymous commenter).
#
# The person ↔ account link is a `claims` relationship with
# epistemic provenance (confidence, method). We don't assert
# "this IS the same person" — we say "here's evidence this
# person controls this account."
#
# This is the universal social graph pivot:
#   Person → claims → Account → owns/moderates → Community
#
# Standards basis: FOAF foaf:OnlineAccount

# See also: .ROADMAP/account-entity.md for full design rationale
