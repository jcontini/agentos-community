# Declaration — Things Made True by Saying Them
#
# Rights, decisions, grants, appointments — speech acts that
# create reality. Declarative speech acts in Searle's framework:
# the word-world fit goes both ways. A judge says "guilty" and
# the person IS guilty. A regulator grants a license and it IS
# granted.
#
# Distinguished from assertions (claims about how the world is)
# and commitments (promises about how the world will be).
# Declarations CREATE the state of affairs they describe.
