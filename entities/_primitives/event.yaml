# Event — Things That Happen
#
# Meetings, parties, launches, conferences — bounded occurrences
# in time. Events are ontological: they exist independent of
# anyone's speech acts about them.
#
# Distinguished from commitments (promises about the future)
# and records (data that was observed). Events are things that
# happen at a time and place.
