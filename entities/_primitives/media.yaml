# Media — Duration-Based Content
#
# The root primitive for all time-based media: video, audio, recordings.
# Independent sibling of document and message — NOT a child of either.
#
# Research basis: Dublin Core (flat siblings), NEPOMUK (Document and Media
# as explicit siblings under InformationElement), Schema.org (MediaObject
# and Article as siblings under CreativeWork). 3 of 5 major standards
# treat media and documents as siblings, not parent-child.
#
# Attribution model: Social media content uses the `posts` relationship
# (account --posts--> media). The account is the observable attribution;
# the person behind it is linked via `claims`. Rich credits (actor,
# director, editor) use `references` with roles — same infrastructure
# as the bundled-content credits graph.
