# Media — Duration-Based Content
#
# The root primitive for all time-based media: video, audio, recordings.
# Independent sibling of document and message — NOT a child of either.
#
# Research basis: Dublin Core (flat siblings), NEPOMUK (Document and Media
# as explicit siblings under InformationElement), Schema.org (MediaObject
# and Article as siblings under CreativeWork). 3 of 5 major standards
# treat media and documents as siblings, not parent-child.
#
# Credits model: `creator` is the primary creator (good for YouTube/social).
# Rich credits (actor, director, editor) use `references` with roles —
# same infrastructure as the bundled-content credits graph.
