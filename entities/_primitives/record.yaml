# Record — Data That Was Recorded
#
# DNS entries, settings, measurements, database rows, sensor
# readings — factual data captured at a point in time.
# Records are ontological: they're observations of the world,
# not speech acts about it.
#
# Distinguished from commitments (promises), declarations
# (things made true by saying them), and events (happenings).
# Records are just data.
