# Writing — The Content Primitive
#
# Anything a person wrote. The universal text content ancestor.
# A message IS a writing (someone wrote it and sent it).
# A post IS a writing (someone wrote it and published it).
# A note IS a writing (someone wrote it for themselves).
#
# Research: NEPOMUK's InformationElement is the closest analog.
# Schema.org lumps everything under CreativeWork. ActivityStreams
# uses Note/Article as flat siblings. We use `writing` because
# it captures the essential act: someone produced text content.
#
# Why not "document"? Documents imply titles, URLs, persistence.
# Messages are writings but not documents. Writing is thinner —
# just content and author — so both documents and messages can
# extend it without semantic mismatch.
