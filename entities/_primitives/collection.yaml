# Collection — Organizational Grouping Primitive
#
# A named grouping of entities. Tags, albums, playlists, folders
# are all collections. The `contains` relationship connects a
# collection to its members.
#
# The `ordered` flag (from ActivityStreams 2.0's Collection vs
# OrderedCollection distinction) tells the UI whether items have
# a user-defined sequence. Tags are unordered. Playlists are ordered.
#
# "Container" is a pattern, not a primitive. Many things contain
# other things (conversations contain messages, blogs contain posts).
# Collection is specifically for organizational grouping.
# Conversations are a different kind of container — they communicate,
# they don't organize.
