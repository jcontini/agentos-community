# Work — Things People Create
#
# The root ontological primitive for all creative output:
# videos, documents, images, audio, software, hardware.
#
# FRBR Work level: the abstract concept that unifies all its
# expressions. "Hamlet", "The Bible", "The Nike Swoosh" — the
# idea itself, independent of any specific realization.
#
# Attribution flows through relationships, not properties:
#   account --upload--> video (to a channel/place)
#   person --claim--> account (identity graph)

# Research: FRBR (Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records),
# BIBFRAME (Library of Congress).
