# Work — Abstract Intellectual or Artistic Creation (FRBR)
#
# The FRBR Work level: the abstract concept that unifies all its
# expressions, manifestations, and items. "Hamlet", "The Bible",
# "The Nike Swoosh" — the idea itself, independent of any specific
# realization.
#
# Most entities don't need a work. A YouTube video is just a video.
# Works appear when you actually have multiple representations:
# - A book as text + audiobook + Kindle edition
# - A logo in SVG + PNG + print
# - A birth certificate with multiple certified copies
#
# FRBR levels connect via `references` relationship roles:
#   expression_of    — concrete content → abstract work
#   manifestation_of — format/edition → expression
#   item_of          — specific copy → manifestation
#
# Research: FRBR (Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records),
# BIBFRAME (Library of Congress) validated collapsing to fewer levels.
# We keep all four but make them opt-in via `references` roles.
