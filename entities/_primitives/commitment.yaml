# Commitment — Promises to Make the World Different
#
# Tasks, outcomes, goals — things an actor commits to achieving.
# Commissive speech acts: the speaker commits to making the
# world match their words (World → Word in Searle's framework).
#
# Replaces the old `outcome` primitive. The key insight: outcomes
# at any scale are commitments. A task is a commitment. A milestone
# is a commitment. A quarterly goal is a commitment.
#
# Status flow: open → in_progress → done | cancelled
# Completion is tracked via the `complete` relationship (assertive
# speech act — claiming the commitment is fulfilled), not a boolean.
