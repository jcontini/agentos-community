# Emotion — Psychological States Actors Feel
#
# Expressive speech acts in Searle's framework: neither Word→World
# nor World→Word. Emotions express a psychological state without
# asserting truth or committing to action.
#
# Emotions in the graph are first-class entities — not just
# properties on other entities. "I feel anxious about this
# project" creates an emotion entity with a `feel` relationship
# to the actor and the project.
