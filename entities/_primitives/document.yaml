# Document — Text-Centric Published Content
#
# Independent root for titled, published text content.
# Posts and webpages are documents. Messages are NOT — they have
# delivery semantics, not publication semantics.
#
# Formerly extended `writing` — now standalone. The `content` and
# `author` properties that writing provided are declared directly.
# "Show me everything by person X" works via graph traversal
# (follow author/creator/sender references), not type inheritance.
#
# The `data` bag is the extension point for adapter-specific
# properties. Community contributors building new entities that
# extend document can use it for domain-specific fields without
# polluting the base schema.
