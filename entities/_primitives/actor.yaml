# Actor — Things That Can Do Things
#
# People, organizations, accounts, AI agents. The subject
# of every relationship edge — actors are always the ones
# acting in the Memex.
#
# Design: "Actor is always the subject." Every edge was created
# by an actor. Accounts link to people via `claim` relationships,
# not type inheritance.
