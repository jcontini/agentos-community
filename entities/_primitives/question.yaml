# Question — A Frame Over a Space of Possible Outcomes
#
# Questions aren't outcomes — they're what GENERATES outcomes.
# "What car should I buy?" frames a decision space.
# "Why is the build failing?" starts an inquiry chain (five whys).
#
# Questions can raise other questions (decomposition, root cause analysis).
# Decisions resolve questions.
#
# Inspired by IBIS (Issue-Based Information System) where issues
# respond to any node in the discourse graph.
