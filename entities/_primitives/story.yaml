# Story — Connected Ideas, Beliefs, Plans
#
# Narratives, projects, roadmaps, life plans — connected sequences
# of ideas with intention and direction. Stories are assertive
# speech acts: they describe the world as the speaker sees it
# (Word → World in Searle's framework).
#
# Design: Stories are the container for plans and narratives.
# They don't contain outcomes directly — they point to a goal
# outcome and the enables graph computes the path.
