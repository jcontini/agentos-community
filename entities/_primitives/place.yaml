# Place — Where Things Exist or Happen
#
# Physical and digital locations. Cities, channels, databases,
# tags, calendars, conversations, playlists — anything that
# contains things is a place.
#
# Design: No `list` primitive — anything that contains things
# is a place. Tags, calendars, conversations, playlists are
# all places. The `add` relationship family puts things into
# places; current membership is computed by netting anti-
# relationships (add/remove).
