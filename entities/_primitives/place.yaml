# Place — Where Things Exist or Happen
#
# Physical and digital locations. Cities, channels, databases,
# tags, calendars, conversations, playlists — anything that
# contains things is a place.
#
# Design: No `list` primitive — anything that contains things
# is a place. Tags, calendars, conversations, playlists are
# all places. The `add` relationship family puts things into
# places; current membership is computed by netting anti-
# relationships (add/remove).
#
# The four categories of place:
#
#   natural/        Bona fide — physical discontinuities draw the boundary.
#                   Continents, landforms, bodies of water. Exist independent
#                   of human declaration. Change on geological timescales.
#
#   administrative/ Fiat — legal declarations draw the boundary. Countries,
#                   regions, cities-as-jurisdictions. Exist because an authority
#                   says so. Can change overnight (new treaty, revolution, law).
#                   Model claims, not truth. Use territorial_claim relationships
#                   for contested places (Kashmir, Taiwan, Crimea).
#
#   built/          Anthropogenic physical. Human-made structures and
#                   environments. Physically real, but named and purposed
#                   by human decision. Venues, buildings, parks, airports.
#
#   digital/        Virtual containers. Channels, forums, repositories,
#                   databases, playlists. Exist in information space.
#
# The bona fide / fiat distinction is from Casati, Smith & Varzi (1996).
# "Fiat" is the same root as fiat currency — value/existence by declaration.
