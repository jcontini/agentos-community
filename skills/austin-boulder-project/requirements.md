# Austin Boulder Project — Reverse Engineering Notes

This file documents the API contract discovered via Playwright network capture.
The portal is a React SPA built on the **Tilefive** platform (`approach.app`).

---

## Status & What's Next

### ✅ Done
- `get_schedule` — fetches live class schedule from `widgets.api.prod.tilefive.com/cal`, fully working from Python and via direct `mcp:call` once the spawn issue below is resolved
- `login` / `refresh_tokens` — Cognito `USER_PASSWORD_AUTH` flow implemented, awaiting credential test
- `book_class`, `cancel_booking`, `get_my_memberships`, `get_my_passes` — implemented from bundle analysis
- `discover_config` — dynamic API key + Cognito config extraction from app bundle with fallback constants
- `readme.md` skill YAML — all operations defined, `auth: none` for public schedule, credential-gated for booking
- `docs/building-web-skills.md` — key learnings (httpx/http2, JA4 fingerprinting, Sec-Fetch headers) captured for future skills

### 🔴 Blocked: MCP spawn error
`run({ skill: "austin-boulder-project", tool: "get_schedule" })` via MCP fails with
`"Failed to spawn process: No such file or directory"`. Likely cause: `working_dir: .`
in the YAML command block resolves unexpectedly, or `python3` is not in the engine daemon's PATH.
Other skills (kitty, granola) use the same pattern — diff against one of those to find the fix.

### 📋 Needs credentials
- `login(email, password)` — needs a real ABP account to verify Cognito flow end-to-end
- `book_class` body payload — `{"numGuests": 0}` is our best guess from the bundle; needs one live booking attempt to confirm or correct
- `get_my_memberships` / `get_my_passes` — need login to test response shape

- `entranceRequirement: "MP"` — likely "Membership/Pass" required
- `billingType: "fcfs"` — first come first served

### 7. Carts ✅ (seen in browser capture)
```
GET https://widgets.api.prod.tilefive.com/carts/{cart-uuid}
```
Guest cart UUID appears to be auto-created per session.

### 8. Marketing Settings

## Widgets API — Required Headers ✅ SOLVED

All three required headers for `widgets.api.prod.tilefive.com`:

```
X-Api-Key: <widgetsApiKey from bundle>    ← tenant API key (exact casing)
Authorization: boulderingproject          ← namespace/tenant ID (NOT a JWT!)
Origin: https://boulderingproject.portal.approach.app
```

### Authorization header — the tricky part

This is NOT a bearer token. The app bundle contains this function:

```js
Jl = () => {
  const { host, protocol, hostname } = window.location;
  if (localhost || file:// || 192.168.x.x)  return "alpha1";
  return host.split(".")[0];   // → "boulderingproject"
}
```

Then the widgets axios client is created as:
```js
Fe = async () => ({
  baseURL: si.widgetsApiRoot[region],
  headers: {
    Authorization: Jl(),         // ← "boulderingproject" (the subdomain)
    "X-Api-Key": si.widgetsApiKey[region]
  }
})
```

The API Gateway uses this to route to the correct tenant. When a user IS logged in,
the authenticated portal API uses a real Cognito `IdToken` as `Authorization` instead.

### X-Api-Key — how to find it

1. Load the portal in a browser (or Playwright)
2. Get the main bundle URL from the HTML — it looks like `/assets/app-HASH.js`
3. Fetch that bundle and search for the string `widgetsApiKey`
4. It appears in an object like:
   ```js
   widgetsApiKey:{"us-east-1":"<40-char alphanumeric key>","ap-southeast-2":"<key>"}
   ```

Regex that extracts it:
```python
re.search(r'"widgetsApiKey"\s*:\s*\{[^}]*"us-east-1"\s*:\s*"([^"]{30,})"', bundle_text)
# OR (minified variant):
re.search(r'widgetsApiKey:\{"us-east-1":"([^"]{30,})"', bundle_text)
```

Key format: ~40 alphanumeric characters, starts with `OQ2z4Q...` (as of Mar 2026).

### Why urllib/requests failed (but httpx works)

`requests`/`urllib3` only advertises `http/1.1` in the TLS ALPN extension.
CloudFront WAF uses JA4 fingerprinting which includes ALPN as a field.
~98% of real browser traffic is HTTP/2+, so ALPN=http/1.1 is a bot signal.
`httpx` with `http2=True` advertises `h2, http/1.1` — matching browsers.
See `abp.py` `_fetch()` for implementation.

### Bundle access note
The bundle `app-HASH.js` redirects to portal HTML when fetched by most tools.
`discover_config()` in `abp.py` tries a direct fetch with browser-like headers,
falling back to hardcoded constants if that fails.

The bundle also exposes:
- `widgetsApiRoot.us-east-1` = `https://widgets.api.prod.tilefive.com`
- `apiRoot.us-east-1`        = `https://portal.api.prod.tilefive.com`
- `approachApiRoot`           = `https://app.api.prod.tilefive.com`

---

## Authentication

### Method
**AWS Cognito** — confirmed by:
- App bundle loads `/assets/aws-BmFRG873.js` (AWS Amplify/SDK)
- Region endpoint returns `us-east-1`
- Login form is React SPA: email + password fields, no HTML `<form>` tag

### Cognito Config ✅ FOUND (extracted from app bundle)

Found alongside `widgetsApiKey` in the main bundle, under `aws:`:
```js
aws:{userPoolId:"us-east-1_XXXXXXXX",userPoolClientId:"<26-char alphanumeric>", ...}
```

Regex:
```python
re.search(r'userPoolId\s*:\s*"(us-east-1_[A-Za-z0-9]+)"', bundle_text)
re.search(r'userPoolClientId\s*:\s*"([A-Za-z0-9]{20,60})"', bundle_text)
```

Current values (as of Mar 2026): `us-east-1_x871N...` / `jikhc095m6r9...`

Expected Cognito request:
```
POST https://cognito-idp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/
X-Amz-Target: AWSCognitoIdentityProviderService.InitiateAuth
Content-Type: application/x-amz-json-1.1

{
  "AuthFlow": "USER_PASSWORD_AUTH",
  "ClientId": "<client_id>",
  "AuthParameters": { "USERNAME": "<email>", "PASSWORD": "<password>" }
}
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "AuthenticationResult": {
    "AccessToken": "...",
    "IdToken": "...",
    "RefreshToken": "...",
    "ExpiresIn": 3600
  }
}
```

### Login Flow (Browser UX)
1. Page load → location picker dialog (radio `value="{location_id}"`) → SAVE
2. Login form appears: `Email *` + `Password *` + `SIGN IN` button
3. Submit → Cognito `InitiateAuth` → tokens returned
4. Tokens used as `Authorization: Bearer <AccessToken>` on authenticated endpoints

---

## Booking Flow ✅ (endpoints confirmed from bundle)

The booking flow is simpler than the cart flow — it's a single POST call.

### How to book

```
POST https://portal.api.prod.tilefive.com/bookings/{bookingInstanceId}/customers
Authorization: {Cognito IdToken}     ← NOT AccessToken, NOT "Bearer ..."
Content-Type: application/json
Origin: https://boulderingproject.portal.approach.app

{ "numGuests": 0 }   ← body TBD — needs live capture to confirm
```

`bookingInstanceId` = the `id` field from the `/cal` response (e.g. `826115`)

### Authorization: IdToken (not AccessToken)

The authenticated portal client (`Ie()` in the bundle) uses the Cognito **IdToken**:
```js
bI = async () => (await zE()).tokens?.idToken
Ie = async () => {
  if (loggedIn) { headers = { Authorization: await bI() } }
  return axios.create({ baseURL: apiRoot, headers })
}
```
→ Pass `auth["IdToken"]` from `login()`, not `auth["AccessToken"]`.

### How to cancel

```
DELETE https://portal.api.prod.tilefive.com/bookings/{bookingInstanceId}/reservations/{reservationId}
Authorization: {Cognito IdToken}
```

`reservationId` comes from the `book_class()` response.

### Other authenticated endpoints (from bundle)

```
GET /customers/memberships    ← active memberships
GET /customers/passes         ← active class passes
GET /customers/bookings       ← upcoming bookings (path inferred, needs confirmation)
GET /bookings/{id}/customers  ← who's booked into a class
```

### Entrance requirements

Classes with `entranceRequirement: "MP"` require an active membership or pass.
Use `get_my_memberships()` / `get_my_passes()` to check before booking.
Error response when requirement not met is unknown — needs live capture.

### Cart flow (for paid bookings / passes — not needed for free class bookings)

The bundle also has cart endpoints (via `Fe()` = widgets API):
```
PUT /carts            ← create/update cart
GET /carts/{uuid}     ← get cart
PUT /carts/session/{id}/cards  ← add payment card
```
Used for purchasing memberships and passes, not for free class registration.

## Schedule Embed URL Pattern

The public schedule embed (no login required in browser):
```
https://boulderingproject.portal.approach.app/schedule/embed?categoryIds=4%2C5%2C6
```
Category IDs: `4` = Climbing Classes, `5` = Yoga, `6` = Fitness

The embed calls `/cal` with date range and `activityId=4,5,6`.
Time offsets suggest UTC — Austin is UTC-5 (CST) or UTC-6 (CDT).
The embed uses `startDT` at `05:00:00Z` = midnight CST.
